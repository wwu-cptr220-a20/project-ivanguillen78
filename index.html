                    Discovering new music can sometimes be a hassle. People will often find themselves growing tired of hearing the same few songs 
                    and will try to find new music. However, this isn't always as easy it seems. For example, people are clearly looking for new music 
                    within a certain genre. Likewise, they could be looking for music that is similar, but slightly different than what they're used to. 
                    Of course, you could click around and hopefully find a few songs that fit what you're searching for. However, many people either do 
                    not have the time to do so or don't want to.

                    There are apps, such as <a class="p" href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a>, that create personalized playlists based on what you listen to. 
                    However, I have found that the playlists are typically made up of songs that you already listen to, with a few others sprinkled in. 
                    Personally, I don't like these playlists. From my point of view, they often take a few songs within the same genre and make a playlist 
                    based on these songs. However, the songs they add to playlist aren't songs I would normally listen to or enjoy. Other apps, such as 
                    <a class="p" href="https://www.apple.com/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> will simply suggest playlists based on genres you listen to.

                    Often times, what can make your search for new music difficult is the fact that you may be searching alone. How many times have you been with a
                    friend and they play a song you have never heard before. After hearing it, you ask them what the name of the song was and all of the sudden, you not
                    only have a new song, but potentially a new artist or even genre. From my personal experience, I have found that hanging around other people is often the
                    best way to discover new things, including music.

                    With COVID-19, it is clearly difficult to maintain pre-COVID-19 levels of human interaction. This application would provide a means for users to communicate with
                    others. Additionally, through different interactions, you would be able to discover new music, artists, and genres. And who knows... Perhaps you'll even make a friend 
                    along the way.
