                    Discovering new music can sometimes be a hassle. People will often find themselves growing tired of hearing the same few songs 
                    and will try to find new music. However, this isn't always as easy it seems. For example, people are clearly looking for new music 
                    within a certain genre. Likewise, they could be looking for music that is similar, but slightly different than what they're used to. 
                    Of course, you could click around and hopefully find a few songs that fit what you're searching for. However, many people either do 
                    not have the time to do so or don't want to.

                    There are apps, such as <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">Spotify</a>, that create personalized playlists based on what you listen to. 
                    However, I have found that the playlists are typically made up of songs that you already listen to, with a few others sprinkled in. 
                    Personally, I don't like these playlists. From my point of view, they often take a few songs within the same genre and make a playlist 
                    based on these songs. However, the songs they add to playlist aren't songs I would normally listen to or enjoy. Other apps, such as 
                    <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> will simply suggest playlists based on genres you listen to.

                            The problem often lies in the fact that you are searching on your own. Imagine a web application that provides the 
                            opportunity to discover new music by interacting with other users. 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Something similar to <a href="https://www.chosic.com/playlist-generator/">this</a>? I'd be interested to see how this application
                            creates playlists based on the song you input. I tested it a few times, and it was, for the most part, accurate in creating appropriate 
                            playlists.
